# lucky-ticket
The project is a program to determine if a tram ticket is lucky according to two systems: the Moscow system and the Saint Petersburg system.

1. **Input**: The user enters a ticket number with 6 digits.
2. **Moscow system**: The ticket is lucky if the sum of the digits in the first half of the number equals the sum of the digits in the second half.
3. **Saint Petersburg system**: The ticket is lucky if the sum of the digits in the odd positions equals the sum of the digits in the even positions.
4. **Super ticket**: The ticket is lucky according to both systems.

The program does not use loops or string slicing to perform the checks.
